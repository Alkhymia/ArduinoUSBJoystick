==================
This code is origined from Darran's project Arduino UNO Big joystick HID firmware: http://hunt.net.nz/users/darran/weblog/15f92/
with out Darran's code I will never make this work. Thanks Darran.

This project requires LUFA library 130901, you can download it at here:
https://code.google.com/p/lufa-lib/downloads/detail?name=LUFA-130901.zip&can=2&q=

Extract the zip file and put it under the project's root directory
the dir tree  should like this:
